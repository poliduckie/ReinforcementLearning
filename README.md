# ðŸš— PoliDuckie Reinforcement Learning ðŸš™
Folder with our experiments on autonomous driving with Reinforcement Learning and the [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) platform.

## Preprocessing
We tried line extraction and bird eye view. During training we saw improvements using line extraction while birdeye didn't improve our model.
